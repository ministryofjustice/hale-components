<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are a small, trusted, independent body of legal policy experts chaired by a Court of Appeal Judge. We have four teams of lawyers and researchers focusing on distinct areas of law. Each team is led by a Commissioner who is an experienced judge, barrister, solicitor or teacher of law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are a non-departmental public body of the Ministry of Justice, but we take on projects across Whitehall and the Welsh Government.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we do</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We keep the law of England and Wales under review and make recommendations for development and reform where needed. This is because:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>sometimes the law is too complex and out of date – it needs to be simplified and modernised</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>the law has not kept up with social attitudes and needs a fresh approach to balance competing rights</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>new technologies emerge and need a comprehensive legal framework to be developed</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are a world leader in law reform and our work ensures that the law and policy in a particular area is as fair, modern, simple and cost-effective as possible. We do this through intensive research, analysis and consultation. We produce comprehensive recommendations for the UK and Welsh Governments, Parliament and Senedd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our Commissioners are outstanding in their fields, our legal staff have expertise in law reform, and we have Parliamentary Counsel based in-house. Our reputation and independence mean people trust us, allowing us to carry out in-depth, high-quality consultations and build consensus around proposals.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Law Commission and independence</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Law Commission is an independent statutory body. This means it operates at arm’s length from government and reports directly to UK Parliament and Senedd Cymru.</p>
